## Description
For this project I use MATLAB to create random walks; which are used to simulate the growth of the DGEBA(diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A) monomer. A popular liquid epoxy resin with a variety of industrial applications.

## Explaination of the Code
To simulate the growth. I tested random walks on 6 different sizes in grams(8,500 | 17,000 | 51,000 | 170,000 | 680,000 | 2,040,000) labeled in the code as cases. The molar mass of a single one is 340 grams; with a length of 10 Angstrom.
